# Certification
Providers are expected to complete self-testing with the [RESO Commander](https://commander.reso.org) prior to certification. See the section on [RESO Certification](https://commander.reso.org/#reso-certification).

# RESO Analytics
RESO Analytics is a new way of looking at standardization. It allows the community and RESO as an organization better understand what's being used in practice. 

Goals
* Allow data consumers to find standard data sets across markets and different providers.
* Help providers improve the standardization rates and responsiveness of their servers through objective, automated testing.
* Create industry aggregates to show usage and adoption metrics.
