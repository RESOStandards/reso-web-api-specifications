# Synopsis
This proposal establishes a normative JSON data format that corresponds with the RESO Data Dictionary and is compatible with existing Web API implementations for retrieving or creating data.

This format is not limited to JSON Web APIs and may be used with any data source, for instance an S3 bucket or web hooks event. Both single- and multi-valued payloads are supported. Another use is as a standard format for off-chain data and distributed ledgers.

Local data elements are also supported.  

# Rationale
The RESO Web API is used primarily by MLS data providers, and it's important they provide a common interface for metadata, query support, and payload formats throughout the MLS landscape due to its decentralized nature. The RESO Web API provides a standard API Gateway for the MLS domain.

There are other participants in the real estate transaction and ecosystem that benefit from having a standard payload format to provide interoperability between various systems. For example, assessment or showing providers. 

In these cases, their API services might be structured differently than the RESO Web API standard but the data is in the same format and therefore is interoperable with other providers.


# Proposal
The RESO Data Dictionary is a transport-independent representation of data models within the RESO domain.

The RESO Web API uses a versioned, JSON-based representation of the Data Dictionary which is generated from its specification. 

The goal of this proposal is to generalize that format.

## Context
When using the RESO Web API clients can infer the Data Dictionary models they're representing, as there's a normative URI structure that corresponds to advertised data elements.

When working with Data Dictionary JSON Payloads, the context of the data isn't clear. 

In order to address this, a special context variable will be added to RESO Data Dictionary data to indicate which model and version is being represented in the payload. 

RESO has a [Uniform Resource Name (URN) namespace](https://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-formal/reso) registered with IANA. 

Section 3.4.1 of this proposal shows a representation of a versioned Data Dictionary resource: 

```
3.4.1 RESO Data Dictionary Metadata Elements
  (a) Versioned Metadata Resource Element

      Format:
        urn:reso:metadata:{version}:resource:{resource-name}

      where "version" MAY have values such as "1.6" or "1.7", and
      "resource-nameÂ¨ is one of "Property", "Member", "Office", or 
      other resource definitions RESO provides (see references).

      Example: 
        urn:reso:metadata:1.7:resource:property
```

[**READ MORE about URNs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name)

For each of the payload formats described in the proposal, a context variable will be added to indicate which Data Dictionary model it's referring to. 

**Example**

RESO Context variable for a Data Dictionary 1.7 Property Resource:

```
{
  "@reso.context": "urn:reso:metadata:1.7:resource:property",
  ...
}
```

Those working with the Data Dictionary JSON format should be prepared to extract versioned standard data elements such as fields and lookups using RESO reference metadata, as there may be local data in the payload whose schema is unknown ahead of time. 

There are metadata resources and services available to assist in doing this. Please contact dev@reso.org for more information. 

Since the Data Dictionary also defines related objects or collections for each resource, such as ListAgent as a Member record or Media as a collection of Media items in a Property Resource, the versioned resource in the URN provides enough information to interpret these items as well.

Additional parameters may be added to the URN to indicate such things as a particular action that goes along with the payload.

## Representations
There are two possible representations for Data Dictionary JSON Payloads:
* **Single-valued payloads** represent a value for a single record at the top level. 
* **Multi-valued payloads** represent a collection of zero or more records, where zero items means the empty list `[]`.

These are outlined in the following sections.

### Single-Valued Payloads
In many cases, such as Add/Edit, it's convenient to be able to represent a single, top-level JSON Data Dictionary item:

```json
{
  "@reso.context": "urn:reso:metadata:1.7:resource:property",
  "Country": "CA",
  "StateOrProvince": "YT",
  "City": "Dawson City",
  "PostalCode": "Y0B 1G0",
  "StreetName": "Bayshore Rd",
  "StreetNumber": "1803",
  "Media": [
    {
      "ResourceName": "Property",
      "MediaCategory": "Branded Virtual Tour",
      "MediaType": "mov",
      "MediaURL": "https://example.com/vJVDL415WZ7GE1/",
      "ShortDescription": "Example"
    },
    {
      "ResourceName": "Property",
      "MediaCategory": "Floor Plan",
      "MediaType": "pdf",
      "MediaURL": "https://example.com/vJVDL415WZ7GE1/doc/floorplan_imperial.pdf",
      "ShortDescription": "imperial"
    }
  ],
  "Rooms": [
    {
      "RoomType": "Dining",
      "RoomName": "Breakfast",
      "RoomWidth": 4.409,
      "RoomLength": 2.977,
      "RoomLengthWidthUnits": "Meters",
      "RoomLengthWidthSource": "LocalProvider"
    },
    {
      "RoomType": "Dining",
      "RoomName": "Dining",
      "RoomWidth": 4.3,
      "RoomLength": 5.998,
      "RoomLengthWidthUnits": "Meters",
      "RoomLengthWidthSource": "LocalProvider"
    }
  ]
}
```

It's also important to support this format to maintain interoperability with existing Web API clients and servers.

### Multi-Valued Payloads

Multi-valued payloads are also possible, in which case the response contains an array property called `value`, which is a collection of zero or more items corresponding to the Data Dictionary model annotated in `@reso.context`.

Using the payload in the previous example:

```json
{
  "@reso.context": "urn:reso:metadata:1.7:resource:property",
  "value": [
    {
      "Country": "CA",
      "StateOrProvince": "YT",
      "City": "Dawson City",
      "PostalCode": "Y0B 1G0",
      "StreetName": "Bayshore Rd",
      "StreetNumber": "1803",
      "Media": [
        {
          "ResourceName": "Property",
          "MediaCategory": "Branded Virtual Tour",
          "MediaType": "mov",
          "MediaURL": "https://example.com/vJVDL415WZ7GE1/",
          "ShortDescription": "Example"
        },
        {
          "ResourceName": "Property",
          "MediaCategory": "Floor Plan",
          "MediaType": "pdf",
          "MediaURL": "https://example.com/vJVDL415WZ7GE1/doc/floorplan_imperial.pdf",
          "ShortDescription": "imperial"
        }
      ],
      "Rooms": [
        {
          "RoomType": "Dining",
          "RoomName": "Breakfast",
          "RoomWidth": 4.409,
          "RoomLength": 2.977,
          "RoomLengthWidthUnits": "Meters",
          "RoomLengthWidthSource": "LocalProvider"
        },
        {
          "RoomType": "Dining",
          "RoomName": "Dining",
          "RoomWidth": 4.3,
          "RoomLength": 5.998,
          "RoomLengthWidthUnits": "Meters",
          "RoomLengthWidthSource": "LocalProvider"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Those using Data Dictionary JSON Payloads should be prepared to check for the `value` property to determine whether to interpret the payload as single- or multi-valued.

# Impact
This proposal doesn't introduce any additional requirements for current RESO Web API providers. Data Dictionary JSON Payloads are designed to be interoperable with their current formats. 

# Compatibility
RESO Data Dictionary 1.7+.

# Certification Impact
Draft implementations (2) have been verified and certification tools have been requested in order to provide reports in RESO Analytics.
