# Submitting a Change Proposal
Once a proposal is ready to move forward from the initial discussion, the next step is to create an RCP. 

1. Fork the repo and clone locally
2. Make a branch called `rcp-###-your-description-goes-here` and a file called `rcp-###-your-description-goes-here.md` in the `/proposals` directory using the [**RCP Template**](./rcp-template.md), where `###` is the number of the RCP that was issued when the ticket was approved
3. When you're ready to publish, make a Draft PR on the Transport repo
